Plugins
=======

Use this directory for TypoScript resources that are needed for FE plugins and 3rd party extensions. To control the inclusion order, you should use file name prefixes like `10_firstfile.t3s`, `20_secondfile.t3s` and so on.

Complex TypoScript configurations may be split into separate files and / or put into subdirectories. Remember to manually include them in case you are using TYPO3 CMS < 6.2 (see [here](../plugins.t3s) for details).
